# Hi there 👋 This is Roode2243,  
When curiosity meets caffeine, you’ll probably find me coding, tinkering, or daydreaming ideas into code.  

🔭 Currently juggling a bunch of random (but awesome) side-projects  
🌱 Learning whatever grabs my attention—from scripts to full-blown apps  
🤝 Open to collabs on anything cool, quirky, or challenging  
💬 Talk to me about manga, tech, or weird internet rabbit holes  
📫 Ping me if you’ve got an idea worth building—or just wanna say hi  
⚡ Fun fact: I name my bugs like Pokémon. Some of them evolve. Most just faint.
